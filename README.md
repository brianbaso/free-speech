# Free Teach

## What is it?
Free Teach is a lecture series club where like-minded individuals get together to teach and learn. At a club meeting, everyone is required to prepare a lecture that spans from five to ten minutes. After each lecture, time will be allotted for questions and debate. Free Teach meetings provide a healthy and civil environment for discussing all kinds of ideologies. Participants will be challenged on their ideas, never their character for having controversial opinions.  

## What is the purpose?
The purpose of Free Teach meetings are to spread new ideas and to change perspectives on current ones. 
* **Lecturing:** *“Those who know, do. Those that understand, teach.”* - Aristotle. Truly understanding a topic means you should be able to teach it. When you are passionate about something, it can be empowering to talk about it with others who will give you their undivided attention and return great feedback. 
* **Listening:** Gather with a group of diverse people and get deep insights on topics you may have never heard of before. Rediscover the ideas in your head by listening to them from an alternative view.
