* **Lecturing:** *“Those who know, do. Those that understand, teach.”* - Aristotle. Truly understanding a topic means you should be able to teach it. When you are passionate about something, it can be empowering to talk about it with others who will give you their undivided attention and return great feedback. 
* **Listening:** Gather with a group of diverse people and get deep insights on topics you may have never heard of before. Rediscover the ideas in your head by listening to them from an alternative view.
